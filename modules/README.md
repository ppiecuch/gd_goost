# Modules

This directory contains both builtin and community modules. Builtin modules are
officially maintained by the Goost authors and are versioned as part of the
extension. Community modules represent `git` submodules which are maintained by
third-party developers.

For further instructions on how to create built-in and link community modules,
see Goost documentation:
