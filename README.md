This is a [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) 3.2+ extension
implemented as a
[C++ module](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html).

The extension consists of functional components and other modules, most of which
should be optional to build.

See [Goost official documentation](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/gd3/) for
detailed instructions on how to use the module, and the list of currently
implemented components.

For a complete list of currently implemented classes, refer to
[Goost API](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/gd3/classes/index.html).

### Goals üéØ
- ***Complement*** the engine by implementing missing or not-yet-implemented
  functionality as seen useful by the Godot community, helping to prevent
  further engine bloat to a reasonable extent;
- Provide additional core data structures, classes and methods to optimize
  performance-critical tasks in a general-purpose way for when GDScript or other
  languages are too slow, or when better integration is desired with existing
  libraries;
- Expose, reuse, and build upon the engine's hidden built-in functionality
  typically unavailable to scripting;
- Overcome engine limitations which may be difficult to do via script,
  especially when those limitations can be mitigated on the module level without
  having to maintain a custom version of the engine.

### Non-goals üåí
- Solving project-specific problems. Consider alternative projects such as
  [Godot Node Extensions](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-next)
  instead.
- Collecting arbitrary community C++ modules for the sake of it. Goost provides
  a separate project for this purpose in the
  [goostengine/godot-modules](https://github.com/goostengine/godot-modules)
  repository, which also includes this extension as a `git` submodule.

## Building üèó

For testing purposes, build artifacts are uploaded for Linux, macOS, and Windows
editor builds and can be downloaded manually for each recently built commit:

- [üêß Linux](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/actions?query=workflow%3A%22%F0%9F%90%A7+Linux%22+branch%3Agd3)
- [üçé macOS](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/actions?query=workflow%3A%22%F0%9F%8D%8E+macOS%22+branch%3Agd3)
- [üé® Windows](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/actions?query=workflow%3A%22%F0%9F%8E%A8+Windows%22+branch%3Agd3)

### Compiling

```sh
git clone https://github.com/goostengine/goost
cd goost
scons
```

This will clone the Godot Engine repository and compile the engine with Goost.
You'll find the resulting binaries at `godot/bin` directory relative to the
Goost repository.

For more advanced compilation options, refer to
[Goost Installation](https://goost.readthedocs.io/en/gd3/usage/installation.html)
documentation pages.

## Development üß±

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in development and to
find out what kind of features are accepted.

### Writing tests

While not mandatory, developers are encouraged to write unit tests (or any tests
for that matter) for any existing or new features.

See [Tests](tests/README.md) for details.

### Writing documentation

The documentation can be generated for new classes, and updated for existing
ones. See the following official documentation pages for further instructions:

- [Contribute to the Class Reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/updating_the_class_reference.html)
- [Writing custom documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/development/cpp/custom_modules_in_cpp.html#writing-custom-documentation)

### Versioning and compatibility

There are separate branches which are targeted for specific Godot Engine's major
version.

Regarding latest extension development version, switch to
* [`gd3`](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/tree/gd3) branch for Godot 3.2+
* [`gd4`](https://github.com/goostengine/goost/tree/gd4) branch for Godot 4.x (does not exist yet).

Similarly, you may use any of the stable branches with a similar branch
encoding, such as `1.0-gd3` or `1.0-gd4`, if available.

Any new features are encouraged to be developed against the latest Godot
Engine's *stable* version, which may be optionally ported to the latest engine's
*development* version (independently or in sync, depending on priorities).

## License üìù

Unless otherwise specified, the extension is released under the
[MIT license](LICENSE.txt).

See the full list of third-party libraries with their licenses used by this
extension at [thirdparty/README.md](thirdparty/README.md) (MIT compatible).
